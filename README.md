## Harry Potter Project - Welcome to your 1st day at Hogwarts!
Congrats to all the new students who have recently been accepted to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and to all the returning students, welcome back! There's a lot to cover during the next year at Hogwarts. Before we start, let's assign the new students to a house.

## Installation
Clone this repo from Github. CD into the main directory using your console and run `bundle install` to install all Gem dependencies.

## Launch Your App
To launch this app, go into the root folder and type 'ruby bin/run.rb'.

## The Magic Behind This CLI App
With this CLI App, an incoming or returning student at Hogwarts wishing to finally fulfill their dreams of being a wizard or witch will be able to add their names to a roster of other talented wizards/witches. This CLI App will first ask the hopeful student what their name is and then prompt them to choose one of the options from the Sorting Hat. Based on your choice, the Sorting Hat will assign you to a house. A house like a family when you're at Hogwarts.

After you're assigned to a house, you have the opportunity to meet your fellow housemates and teachers (if you want, but let's be nice and social). If you're a returning a student, you won't be assigned to a new house, BUT you'll still be able to enjoy the delicious food that Hogwarts has to offer.
